# DynamoDB to ElasticSearch

I am going to modify this source code from python to node.js

This package allow you to easily ZIP a Lambda function and start processing DynamoDB Streams in order to index your DynamoDB objects in ElasticSearch.

It processed the following events:

   - INSERT
   - REMOVE
   - MODIFY

We force an index refresh for each event, for close to realtime indexing.

The DynamoDB JSON objects are unmarshaled and types are correctly converted. (Binary types have never been tested though)

List of numbers and strings are converted to list of Strings. ES doesn't allow arrays of different data types.

Blog reference explaining what we're doing here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/indexing-amazon-dynamodb-content-with-amazon-elasticsearch-service-using-aws-lambda/

Unfortunatly, AWS removed the Lambda Blueprint doing what we are doing here. So we've done it ourself again.

# Get started

The deployment process is done through the Makefile.

You need to declare the following environment variables to get started:

   - AWS_BUCKET_CODE: Where your Lambda function will go in AWS S3
   - IAM_ROLE: The IAM role you created for the Lambda function to run with
   - ENV: The environment you're running: DEV, QA, PROD, STAGE, ... This is used to pull the correct config file from S3
   - PROFILE (optional): The AWS profile to use to deploy. Will use default profile by default ...

Obvisouly you need your AWS environment setup correctly.

## Create a config file

Create a simple file named `${ENV}_es_creds` and put the following in it:

```
ES_ENDPOINT='https://search-esclust-esclus-xxxxx-xxxxxx.{region}.es.amazonaws.com'
```

This file just contains the endpoint to your cluster. You should have one file per environment.

Upload it to your bucket where the Lambda function will also be uploaded.

Before Zipping the function, we will download that file locally and will inject it in the Lambda function as the file `lib/env.py`. The function depends on it and `import` this file.

That allows you to NOT hardcode your endpoint.
This way you can deploy several functions for different clusters and environments without touching the code.

Just set your environment variables `ENV` correctly, name your file right, upload it and that's it.

## Create the function

The first time you need to create the function in AWS Lambda.

```
make create/DynamoToES DESC="Process DynamoDB stream to ES"
```

This will download your config file from S3, install all the Python packages in the `build` folder, ZIP the whole thing, upload the ZIP file to S3 and create your Lambda function. The default is 128MB. You can change the memory of your function with the Makefile or in the console.

## Update the function

Let's say you make some changes to the code.

```
make deploy/DynamoToES DESC="Process DynamoDB stream to ES"
```

That will update the ZIP and refresh your Lambda function.
